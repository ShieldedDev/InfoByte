## Task Descriptions

Below are the descriptions of the internship tasks I've worked on:

1. **Task 1**: []()
   - Description: 
   - 

2. **Task 2**: [BMI Calculator](https://github.com/ShieldedDev/InfoByte/blob/main/bmi_calculator.py)
   - Description:
   - This is a simple Python script that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height. BMI is a commonly used metric to assess body weight relative to height and is often used as a screening tool to categorize individuals into different weight status categories. The program provides a BMI value with two decimal places and categorizes the BMI into the following standard weight categories:
      
      - Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
      - Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
      - Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
      - Obese: BMI of 30 or greater
   
      The program will then calculate your BMI and categorize it based on the standard BMI ranges.

3. **Task 3**: [Password Generator](https://github.com/ShieldedDev/InfoByte/blob/main/Password_Generator.py)
   - Description: A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users.

   - This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.
   - User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
   - Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.
   - Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.
